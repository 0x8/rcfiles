# Nullp0inter's rc files
### About:
This repo contains copies of some of my rc (configuration) files that I make use of on my own personal machines. You may feel free to use/edit them as you see fit.
Thanks to GH0S1_R33P0R for the initial vimrc file. I made a handful of minor changes and altered formatting a bit.

### Warnings:
Some of these may add behavior you may or may not expect. Be sure to actually read the files before putting them into use. This is both good practice and should be
common sense, but you never know with some people. Any problems you get from using these are your own and I offer no help officially in solving any issues.

### To Use:
To use them simply put them into your home directory. For Ubuntu based systems you can also add them to `/etc/skel/` if you wish for them to come by default with
the creation of every new user (You can also make doubly sure of this by creating them in this manner: `useradd -m -k /etc/skel ...`
